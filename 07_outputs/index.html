<h3>Week 7: Electronic Outputs</h3>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>My final project will be about a Formula 1 car. The most essential part was to get it working. Therefore, I chose making a drivable F1 car for the minimum viable product project.</h4>

<h3>Sketch in Fusion:</h3>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>This was probably the hardest thing I have designed in Fusion, as I needed to very precise. I used a dc motor, a servo and two rulmans, which were very hard to place. I took many measurements of these parts.</h4>

<h4>My first 3d print failed to do one of the tires, but I already had a problem with the existing tires, they were too small and were not fitting in the parts I made.</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>At the last minute, I reprinted all the tires and the handles that would hold them because both of them broke, as I was trying to take the supports out.</h4>

<h4>This is the video of the completed design.</h4>

<h4>I will put my 3D design assignment and this assignment together to make it a real life looking F1 car. From the assignment, I learned that I should make my parts using other tools because 3D printers can fail and are not durable enough.</h4>
