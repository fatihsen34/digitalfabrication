<h2>Drivable Formula 1 Car Final Project</h2>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h3>-----INITIAL IDEA-----</h3>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>I normally had more complex ideas for my final project. However, as time past, I realized that only doing a drivable car would be hard enough. So, as a huge F1 fan, I decided to create something I always wanted to do, a drivable Formula 1 car.</h4>

<h3>-----3D ASSIGNMENT-----</h3>

<h4>Everything started when I designed a Formula 1 car on Fusion from my mind, not even looking at a reference.</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>I used that design to make my 3D printing assignment. After one failed attempt, I was able to make a nice looking car. The prints are present in the documentation video.</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h3>-----MVP ASSIGNMENT-----</h3>

<h4>Furthermore, my mvp assignment was about making the mechanisms to make the rear tyres rotate and the front tyres turn. The result is also in the video.</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>After taking some measurements, I noticed that I needed to make the car massive to fit the servo. To finish in time, I started building one week prior.</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>Here is the documentation video with times and explanations(you might want to stop to read the texts):</h4>

<h4>The printing probably took more than 100 hours in total, and even tough it was very stressing, I had a lot of fun during the process.</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>Finally, after 41 hours in the lab in 3 and a half days, I completed the car before 11:30 on Thursday, as I was instructed.</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>

<h4>Here is the final result:</h4>
